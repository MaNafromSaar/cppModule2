# C++, BSP, Triangle Completeness, 2D Vector

## Overview
In the subject, there was a hint at a possible algorithm to use here. I didn't.

## BSP (Binary Space Partition)
Certainly a mighty method, as it has made `DOOM` possible and was the doctorate thesis of the founder of Adobe. But in my opinion, it's a cannon way too big to shoot at a 2D triangle. For those who want to do some research:

## Simpler Approach by Pure 2D Geometry
If there is a point and a triangle given, just try to build triangles with that point substituting one vertex after another. If they add up to the area of the original triangle, it always was within.

## Problems and Fixes
- **Negative Quadrants**: 
  - Usual approach: Cut at the axis and take the absolute value of each part.
  - My approach: Shift it a good deal to the right and up. Stay positive all the while. If a shift by 50, 50 does not suffice, I could implement dynamic augmentation of those values but actually, I am more inclined to ask the user if he is aware of sensible construction of a triangle.

- **Edges Included**: 
  - Contrary to BSP, edges are included.
  - I thought about applying some padding but with the fixed decimal point value being rather coarse, this would have given away possibly too much to be a good solution.
  - Solution: A function to check whether the point is exactly on the line which is constructed with the original values. This only excludes a small corridor along the edges that mirrors the precision of the units used.
